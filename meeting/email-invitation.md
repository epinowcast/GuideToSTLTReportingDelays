# Email: Strike team invitation

**To:** InSight Net members and collaborators
**From:** Sam Abbott, Laura Jones
**Subject:** Nowcasting strike team: call for contributors

---

Hi all,

As you may have heard, the InSight Net coordination centre has asked Laura and me to lead a nowcasting strike team, similar to the Rt estimation effort led by Chad Munro and Laura White.

The goal is to produce practical guidance for STLT jurisdictions on accounting for reporting delays and other real-time data challenges, in a similar vein to the [best practices paper by Charniga et al.](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012520) for delay distributions (including things like decision trees for method selection).
We are planning a paper, an interactive website, and a shared code library.
The current outline is at https://github.com/epinowcast/GuideToSTLTReportingDelays.

Each section has a lead and support role to manage contributions from other collaborators, and we are looking for volunteers to fill these.
We are also looking for help thinking through how to best visualise and communicate this guidance interactively.

There is a companion technical overview of nowcasting methods coming out of last year's nowcasting workshop at RIVM, covering the theory and methods in detail (shareable draft in about a month).
This strike team focuses on the practical side, framing what tools are available and when to use them in light of that work.

We are going to have an initial meeting on [date TBD by coordination centre] and are running a session at the next InSight Net meeting with overview talks and rapid presentations (2-5 slides) from participants on their challenges or models.

If you are interested in contributing or presenting, please get in touch.

Best,
Sam and Laura
