title: "Accounting for Reporting Delays in Public Health Surveillance"
---

Public health surveillance data are rarely complete when
first reported.
Cases, hospitalisations, and other events take time to be
confirmed, entered into databases, and reported to
central systems.
These **reporting delays** mean that the most recent data
systematically undercount the true number of events,
complicating real-time analysis.

This guide is designed with and for state, tribal,
local, and territorial (STLT) public health
practitioners and
modellers working with delayed surveillance data.

## What this guide covers

- **Challenges** that arise when using surveillance data in
  real time, including reporting delays, data revisions,
  and site drop-in and drop-out.
- **Modelling approaches** that can adjust for reporting
  delays, from chain-ladder approaches to Bayesian
  hierarchical models.
- **A decision tree** to help select an appropriate method
  based on your data characteristics and use case.
- **A how-to guide** covering the common steps from
  assessing data through to communicating results.
- **Case studies** demonstrating practical implementations
  in surveillance settings.

## Who is this for?

This guide is written for two audiences.

**Epidemiologists and public health practitioners**
interested in accounting for reporting delays and other
real-time data issues.

**Modellers** expanding their understanding of reporting
delays and the methods available to address them.
