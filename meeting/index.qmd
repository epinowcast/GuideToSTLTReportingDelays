title: "InSight Net Session"
---

This guide is being developed collaboratively through
the InSight Net nowcasting strike team.
An initial working session brings together public health
practitioners and modellers to identify shared challenges
and inform the guide's content.

## Session overview

The session (~90 minutes) has three parts.

### Challenges in real-time surveillance data (~40 minutes)

Surveillance data used in real time face several common
challenges: reporting delays, data revisions, site
drop-in and drop-out, and other data quality issues.

1. Laura Jones: overview of challenges (~10 minutes)
2. Rapid presentations from participants on their
   challenges (2-5 slides each, ~15 minutes)
3. Facilitated discussion (~15 minutes)

### Modelling options (~25 minutes)

What modelling approaches are available to address
these challenges?
Covers the range from simple adjustments through to
formal statistical approaches, what data each requires,
and what each gives you in return.

1. Sam Abbott: overview of modelling options (~10 minutes)
2. Rapid presentations from participants on their models
   or tools (2-5 slides each, ~15 minutes)

### Choosing a modelling approach (~20 minutes)

Group session working through how to choose between
approaches for different challenge and data scenarios.
The output will help inform the
[interactive decision tree](../decision-tree.qmd).
