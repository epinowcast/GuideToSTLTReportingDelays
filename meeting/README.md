Planning materials for dissemination and discussion activities.

## Accounting for reporting delays in STLT surveillance data: challenges, models, and practical choices

InSight Net session (~90 minutes)

### Challenges in real-time surveillance data (~40 minutes)

Surveillance data used in real time face several common challenges:

- **Reporting delays:** right-truncation from lab confirmation, manual entry, weekend and holiday effects
- **Data revisions:** duplicate removal, case reclassifications, date corrections
- **Site drop-in and drop-out:** facilities joining, leaving, or reporting intermittently
- **Other data quality issues:** missing or incorrect dates, incompatible formats, missing strata

1. Laura Jones: overview of challenges (~10 minutes)
2. Rapid presentations from participants on their challenges (2-5 slides each, ~15 minutes, see [template](challenges-slides-template.qmd))
3. Facilitated discussion on challenges (~15 minutes, see [discussion prompts](discussion-prompts.md))

### Modelling options to address challenges (~25 minutes)

What modelling approaches are available to address the challenges above?
Covers the range from simple adjustments (discarding recent data, frozen values) through to more formal statistical approaches (chain ladder, GAMs, Bayesian hierarchical models), what data each requires, and what each gives you in return.

1. Sam Abbott: overview of modelling options (~10 minutes)
2. Rapid presentations from participants on their models or tools (2-5 slides each, ~15 minutes, see [template](models-slides-template.qmd))

### Choosing a modelling approach (~20 minutes)

Participant-led group session working through how to choose between modelling approaches for different challenge and data scenarios.
The output from this session will help inform constructing an interactive decision tree for the paper and website.
See [exercise document](decision-tree-exercise.md).

### Wrap-up (~5 minutes)

- Summary of key themes
- How to get involved in the strike team

## Initial strike team meeting

- Date: TBD (coordination centre to confirm)
