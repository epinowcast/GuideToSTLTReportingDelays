Each case study walks through the common steps of
accounting for reporting challenges in a specific
surveillance setting.

## Common steps

Regardless of the challenge or modelling approach,
implementation follows a similar pattern:

1. Assess the data source and the predictability of
   the reporting challenge
2. Analyse delay distributions
3. Identify meaningful strata (e.g. geography, age)
4. Implement and configure the model
5. Validate against historical data
6. Communicate results to decision makers

See the [how-to guide](../how-to.qmd) for detailed
guidance on each step.
