title: "Choosing a Method"
---

::: {.callout-note}
This page is under development.
Content will be drawn from the companion paper
(Section 4: Choosing a modelling method).
The decision tree will be interactive.
:::

Selecting an approach depends on the data available,
the challenge being addressed, and practical
constraints around capacity and infrastructure.

## Decision tree

<!-- Interactive decision tree guiding users through
     method selection based on:
     - Data availability and structure
     - Computational resources
     - Statistical capacity
     - Use case (routine monitoring vs outbreak response)
     - Timeliness requirements

     Implementation options:
     - Mermaid diagram with clickable nodes
     - Observable JS for interactivity
     - Simple flowchart as starting point -->

## Adoption and sustainability

<!-- Advocating to public health leadership.
     Explaining nowcasts to decision makers.
     Justifying system modifications. -->

## Data analysis considerations

<!-- Analysing delay distributions.
     Choosing maximum delay and training window.
     Representativeness.
     What historic data is most informative?
     Determining variables needed, strata of interest. -->

## Implementation considerations

<!-- Emergencies vs chronic delays.
     Software and infrastructure requirements.
     Failure modes.
     Maintaining systems over time.
     Tradeoff between flexibility and complexity. -->

## Validation and evaluation

<!-- Practical qualitative methods
     (flipbooking, alignment with trends).
     Applied quantitative methods
     (coverage, correlation, residuals).
     Advanced methods (WIS, MAE/MSE) for comparison.
     Evaluation for public health utility.
     Against a baseline and other common methods. -->
