Regardless of the specific challenge or modelling approach,
implementing a model to account for reporting issues in
surveillance data involves common steps.

## Assess the data source

<!-- Identify the reporting challenge and its predictability.
     Understand the data structure and available history. -->

## Analyse delays and delay distributions

<!-- Characterise the delay distribution from historical data.
     Choose maximum delay and training window. -->

## Understand meaningful strata

<!-- Determine variables needed and strata of interest
     (e.g. geography, age, race/ethnicity).
     Assess representativeness. -->

## Implement the model

<!-- Select and configure the modelling approach.
     Software and infrastructure requirements.
     Considerations for emergencies vs chronic delays.
     Failure modes and maintaining systems over time. -->

## Validate and evaluate

<!-- Practical qualitative methods (e.g. flipbooking,
     alignment with trends).
     Quantitative methods (coverage, correlation, residuals).
     Advanced methods (WIS, MAE/MSE) for comparison.
     Evaluation for public health utility.
     Compare against a baseline. -->

## Communicate and visualise results

<!-- Present uncertainty to decision makers.
     Choose prediction/confidence intervals.
     Place nowcasts in context (e.g. seasonal thresholds).
     Public-facing output considerations.
     Common pitfalls. -->
