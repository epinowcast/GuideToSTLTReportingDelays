# Introduction

<!-- Section lead: -->
<!-- Section support: -->

State, local, and territorial surveillance systems play a central role in
public health decision making.
However, inherent delays between disease occurrence and reporting create
challenges for real-time analysis.
These delays affect the timeliness and accuracy of public health response.

This guide provides practical guidance for data collectors and modellers
working with reporting delays.
