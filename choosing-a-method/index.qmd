     method selection. Implementation options:
     - Mermaid diagram with clickable nodes
     - Observable JS for interactivity
     - Simple flowchart as starting point -->

## Detailed guidance

- [Data analysis considerations](data-analysis.qmd)
- [Implementation considerations](implementation.qmd)
- [Validation and evaluation](validation.qmd)
