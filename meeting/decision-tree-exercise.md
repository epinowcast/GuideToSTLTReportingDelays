# Choosing a modelling approach: group exercise

This exercise is designed to be participant-led.
The goal is to work through scenarios and surface the questions that matter when choosing how to handle reporting delays and other data challenges.
The output will help inform constructing an interactive decision tree for the paper and website.

## How it works

For each scenario, discuss as a group:

1. What is the main challenge?
2. What data do you have available?
3. What would you try first?
4. What would you need to move to something more formal?
5. What would stop you from using a particular approach?

## Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Weekly syndromic surveillance with stable delays

You receive weekly counts of ED visits for respiratory illness.
Reporting is typically complete within two weeks.
The delay pattern has been stable for over a year.
You need to report current trends to leadership each Monday.

- What approach would you use?
- What would change your answer?

### Scenario 2: Daily case counts during an emerging outbreak

A new pathogen is circulating and case counts are rising.
You are receiving daily case counts by date of symptom onset.
Delays are getting longer as labs come under strain.
Leadership wants daily situational updates.

- What approach would you use?
- How would you handle the changing delays?

### Scenario 3: Site drop-in/drop-out in sentinel surveillance

You monitor hospitalisations across 12 sentinel sites.
Two sites have been intermittently reporting for the past month.
A new site has just joined the network.
You need to produce a jurisdiction-wide estimate.

- Is this a nowcasting problem?
- What would you do?

### Scenario 4: Low counts with long delays

You are tracking a rare condition with 5-10 cases per week.
Reporting delays can be up to 6 weeks.
You have 18 months of historical data.

- What approach would you use?
- What are the limits of what you can say about the current week?

## Questions to capture

As you work through scenarios, note down:

- What questions come up repeatedly?
- What information do you need to make a choice?
- Where do the boundaries between "simple enough" and "need something more formal" fall?
- What would you put in a decision tree?
