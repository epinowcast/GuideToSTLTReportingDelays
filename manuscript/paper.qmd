abstract: |
  State, local, and territorial surveillance systems are essential for public
  health decision making, but inherent delays between disease occurrence and
  reporting create challenges for real-time analysis.
  This guide provides practical guidance for epidemiologists, public health
  practitioners, and modellers working with reporting delays in surveillance
  data.
  We describe challenges in real-time use of surveillance data, opportunities
  from modelling approaches, guidance on choosing appropriate methods,
  considerations for communicating results, and practical case studies with
  implementation resources.
  We also highlight gaps where new modelling methods could address unmet needs
  in public health practice.

# Introduction

**Section lead:** Sam Abbott
**Section support:** TBD

State, local, and territorial surveillance systems play a central role in
public health decision making in the United States.
Similarly, sub-national jurisdictions in other countries also play a signficant role in public health decision making.
However, several challenges complicate the use of surveillance data in real time. 
Reporting delays arise from lab confirmation requirements, differences between electronic and manual reporting, and weekend and holiday effects. 
Data revisions occur as duplicates are removed, cases are reclassified, and dates are corrected. 
Site-specific variations in reporting capabilities and intermittent reporting from some facilities create additional uncertainty. 
Other data quality issues such as missing or incorrect dates and incompatible formats can further limit the utility of recent data.

Common approaches to handling these challenges include pruning recent data or using incomplete data with caveats. However, statistical methods exist that can adjust for these issues by learning from historical patterns.
Addressing these challenges can improve situational awareness of true disease
trends, supports decision making (such as timing of public health
interventions), and can improve forecasting of disease trends and resource needs (i.e. hospitalisations).

In this guide, we provide practical guidance for public health practitioners
and modellers planning to account for reporting delays and other data quality issues in their analyses.
We describe the challenges that arise when using surveillance data in real
time, review modelling approaches that can address these challenges, and
provide guidance on choosing and implementing appropriate methods.
We also highlight gaps where new methods could address unmet needs in practice.
