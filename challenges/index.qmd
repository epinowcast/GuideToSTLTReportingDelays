| Challenge | Description | Examples | Effect on analysis |
|---|---|---|---|
| [Reporting delays](reporting-delays.qmd) | Time between event and report | Lab confirmation, manual entry, weekend effects | Right-truncation of recent counts |
| [Data revisions](data-revisions.qmd) | Changes to previously reported data | Duplicate removal, reclassification, date corrections | Retrospective changes to trends |
| [Site drop-in/out](site-drop-in-out.qmd) | Facilities joining or leaving | New sites, closures, intermittent reporting | Apparent changes unrelated to disease |
| [Other data quality](other-data-quality.qmd) | Additional data issues | Missing dates, format incompatibilities, missing strata | Reduced utility of recent data |
