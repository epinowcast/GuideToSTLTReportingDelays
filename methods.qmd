## Summary

<!-- Filterable table of modelling approaches from the
     paper. Implementation: use OJS or a Quarto
     interactive table with filters for challenge,
     approach, and data requirements. -->

| Challenge | Approach | Examples | Data requirements |
|---|---|---|---|
| Reporting delays | Chain-ladder | baselinenowcast, ChainLadder | Reporting triangle |
| Reporting delays | GAMs | nowcaster, UKHSA GAMs | Reporting triangle |
| Reporting delays | Bayesian hierarchical | NobBS | Reporting triangle |
| Reporting delays | Ad-hoc | EpiNow2 | Case counts + delay estimate |
| Reporting delays | Semi-mechanistic | EpiNow2, epinowcast | Reporting triangle |
| Data revisions | Chain-ladder | baselinenowcast | Data snapshots |
