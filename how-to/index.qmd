Regardless of the specific challenge or modelling
approach, implementing a model to account for reporting
issues in surveillance data involves common steps.

1. [Assess the data source](assess-data.qmd)
2. [Analyse delays and delay distributions](analyse-delays.qmd)
3. [Understand meaningful strata](understand-strata.qmd)
4. [Implement the model](implement.qmd)
5. [Validate and evaluate](validate.qmd)
6. [Communicate and visualise results](communicate.qmd)

See the [case studies](../case-studies/index.qmd) for
worked examples applying these steps, or browse
[community examples](../community-examples/index.qmd)
for implementation examples.
