## Approaches by challenge

| Challenge | Approach | Examples | Data requirements |
|---|---|---|---|
| Reporting delays | [Chain-ladder](chain-ladder.qmd) | baselinenowcast, ChainLadder | Reporting triangle |
| Reporting delays | [GAMs](gams.qmd) | nowcaster, UKHSA GAMs | Reporting triangle |
| Reporting delays | [Bayesian hierarchical](bayesian-hierarchical.qmd) | NobBS | Reporting triangle |
| Reporting delays | Ad-hoc | EpiNow2 | Case counts + delay estimate |
| Reporting delays | [Semi-mechanistic](semi-mechanistic.qmd) | EpiNow2, epinowcast | Reporting triangle |
| Data revisions | [Chain-ladder](chain-ladder.qmd) | baselinenowcast | Data snapshots |
