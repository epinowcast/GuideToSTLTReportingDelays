## Reporting delays

<!-- Right-truncation, lab confirmation delays,
     manual data entry variation -->

## Data revisions

<!-- Deduplication, reclassification,
     date corrections -->

## Surveillance site drop-in and drop-out

<!-- Intermittent facility reporting -->

## Other data quality issues

<!-- Missing dates, incompatible formats,
     changing case definitions -->
