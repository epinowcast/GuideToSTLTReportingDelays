title: "Accounting for Reporting Delays in Public Health Surveillance"
---

Public health surveillance data are rarely complete at the time
of first reporting.
Cases, hospitalisations, and other events take time to be
confirmed, entered into databases, and reported to
central systems.
These **reporting delays** mean that the most recent data
systematically undercount the true number of events,
creating a misleading picture of current trends.

This guide provides practical support for analysts working
with delayed surveillance data at state, local, and
territorial levels.

## What this guide covers

- **Common challenges** that arise when using surveillance
  data in real time, including right-truncation, data
  revisions, and intermittent reporting.
- **Modelling methods** that can adjust for reporting delays,
  from simple chain-ladder approaches to Bayesian
  hierarchical models.
- **A decision tree** to help select an appropriate method
  based on your data, capacity, and goals.
- **Case studies** demonstrating practical implementations
  in real-world surveillance settings.

## Who is this for?

This guide is written for two audiences.

**Epidemiologists and public health practitioners** who
need to interpret or adjust delayed surveillance data as
part of routine operations or outbreak response.

**Modellers** looking to deepen their understanding of
reporting delays and the methods available to address them.
