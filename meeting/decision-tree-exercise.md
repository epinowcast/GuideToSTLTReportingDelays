# Choosing a modelling approach: group exercise

This exercise is designed to be participant-led.
The goal is to work through scenarios and surface the questions that matter when choosing how to handle reporting delays and other data challenges.
The output will help inform constructing an interactive decision tree for the paper and website.

## How it works

Pick a scenario that is closest to your own setting, or bring your own.
As a group, discuss:

1. What is the main challenge?
2. What data do you have available?
3. What would you try first?
4. What would you need to move to something more formal?
5. What would stop you from using a particular approach?

## Example scenarios

These are starting points; participants are encouraged to use their own data and challenges instead.

- **Weekly syndromic surveillance with stable delays:** weekly ED visit counts for respiratory illness, typically complete within two weeks, stable delay pattern, need to report trends each Monday.
- **Daily case counts during an emerging outbreak:** daily counts by symptom onset, delays getting longer as labs come under strain, leadership wants daily updates.
- **Site drop-in/drop-out in sentinel surveillance:** hospitalisations across 12 sentinel sites, two reporting intermittently, one new site, need a jurisdiction-wide estimate.
- **Low counts with long delays:** rare condition with 5-10 cases per week, delays up to 6 weeks, 18 months of historical data.

## Questions to capture

As you work through your scenario, note down:

- What questions come up repeatedly?
- What information do you need to make a choice?
- Where do the boundaries between "simple enough" and "need something more formal" fall?
- What would you put in a decision tree?
