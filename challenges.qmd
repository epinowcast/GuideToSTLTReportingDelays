This page is under development.
Content will be drawn from the companion paper
(Section 2: Challenges in real-time use of
surveillance data).
The table below will be interactive and filterable.

## Summary

<!-- Filterable table of challenges from the paper.
     Implementation: use OJS or a Quarto interactive
     table with filters for challenge type, examples,
     and how it affects analysis. -->

| Challenge | Description | Examples | Effect on analysis |
|---|---|---|---|
| Reporting delays | Time between event and report | Lab confirmation, manual entry, weekend effects | Right-truncation of recent counts |
| Data revisions | Changes to previously reported data | Duplicate removal, reclassification, date corrections | Retrospective changes to trends |
| Site drop-in/out | Facilities joining or leaving | New sites, closures, intermittent reporting | Apparent changes unrelated to disease |
| Other data quality | Additional data issues | Missing dates, format incompatibilities, missing strata | Reduced utility of recent data |

## Reporting delays

<!-- Right-truncation, lab confirmation delays,
     manual data entry variation -->

## Data revisions

<!-- Deduplication, reclassification,
     date corrections -->

## Surveillance site drop-in and drop-out

<!-- Intermittent facility reporting -->

## Other data quality issues

<!-- Missing dates, incompatible formats,
     changing case definitions -->
