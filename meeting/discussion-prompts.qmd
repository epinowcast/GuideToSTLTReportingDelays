Prompts for the facilitated discussion following the
challenges overview and rapid presentations.

## Reporting delays

- What are the most common sources of [reporting delay](../resources/glossary.qmd#reporting-delay)
  in your jurisdiction?
- How long are typical delays for your main surveillance
  streams?
- Have you seen delays change over time (e.g. during
  outbreaks, holiday periods, system changes)?
- How do you currently handle recent incomplete data
  when briefing leadership?

## Data revisions

- How often do your data get revised after initial
  release?
- What causes revisions in your systems (deduplication,
  reclassification, date corrections)?
- Have you experienced large retrospective corrections
  that affected interpretation?

## Site drop-in and drop-out

- Do you have sites that report intermittently?
- How do you handle new sites joining or existing sites
  dropping out of reporting?
- Does this vary between surveillance streams?

## Other data quality issues

- What data quality issues most affect your ability to
  interpret recent trends?
- How do you handle missing dates or strata variables?
- Are there format or system compatibility issues that
  create apparent delays?

## Cross-cutting

- Which of these challenges is the biggest barrier to
  timely analysis in your setting?
- Are there challenges you face that we have not covered?
- What would be most useful to you from this effort?
