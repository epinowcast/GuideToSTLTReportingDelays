Community-contributed examples demonstrating how to
work with delayed surveillance data.
Contributions can include code snippets, data
preparation workflows, package vignettes, or other
practical resources.
Each example is a GitHub Gist linked from the table
below.

## Browse examples

::: {.callout-note}
The table below will be filterable by type, challenge,
approach, and language once examples are submitted.

<!-- Interactive table of examples, populated from
     submitted gists. Columns:

     | Title | Author | Type | Challenge | Approach | Language | Gist |

     Type: code snippet, data preparation, vignette, etc.
     Filterable by type, challenge, approach, and language.
     Similar to the seminars listing on epinowcast.org. -->

## How to submit an example

1. **Write a GitHub Gist** containing your example.
   Include a brief description at the top covering:
   - What it does (code example, data preparation,
     package vignette, etc.)
   - What surveillance data or challenge it addresses
   - What language and packages are needed

2. **Open an issue** using the
   [community example template](https://github.com/epinowcast/GuideToSTLTReportingDelays/issues/new?template=community-example.yml){target="_blank"}
   with a link to your gist and the relevant details.

3. We will review the submission and add it to the table.

## What makes a good example

- Self-contained and runnable where possible
- Uses simulated or publicly available data
- Includes comments explaining key steps
- Clear about what challenge or task it addresses

See the [contributing guide](../contributing.qmd) for
general contribution guidelines.
